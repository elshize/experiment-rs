This Rust crate is used for scripting experiments.

# Description

More information to come soon.

# Using in Your Project

The project is currently not published on `crates.io`,
therefore you must depend on the GitHub version:

    [dependencies]
    experiment = { git = "https://github.com/elshize/experiment-rs.git" }

# Documentation

To view the documentation locally (as it is not yet published),
you can run (use `--no-deps` to skip generating documentation
for the dependencies):

    cargo doc [--no-deps] --open

This will generate the documentation and open it in your default web browser.
